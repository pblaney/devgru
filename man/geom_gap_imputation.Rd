\title{Diagnostic plot used for reviewing the imputation of gaps in segmentation}
\usage{
geom_gap_imputation(original_gap, imputed_gap_gr, sv_bp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_gap}{GenomicRanges object of gap}

\item{imputed_gap_gr}{GenomicRanges object of imputed values across gap}

\item{sv_bp}{GenomicRanges object of structural variant breakpoint that falls within
the original gap, default: NULL}
}
\value{
ggplot object
}
\description{
Creates a simple ggpplot2 style plot for quickly reviewing how the imputation of
each gap identified in a segmentation file

Note, this function was designed to be run as part of the \code{get_segmentation_gap_imputation()}
workflow.
